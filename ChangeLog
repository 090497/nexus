tag v5_00_00 - 28 Oct 2015
	- Change from IRENE to GATE in persistency.
	- 83Kr generator added.
	- Xenon density used in the refractive index calculation taken  from pressure.
	- Event writing skipped if one event is aborted, in order not to have the whole run crashed.
	- Obsolete GenbbInterface class  eliminated. Decay0 to be used instead.
	
tag v4_04_05 - 19 Jun 2015
	- transverse and longitudinal diffusion and electric field strength passed by configuration parameters 
	- Muon generator added
	- Definition of colors in one place, to be used by all the geometry classes.
	- NEW SiPM simulated with the specifications of the Sensl ones. New class (SiPMSensl added)
	- Change in the KDB volume, that is now bigger than reality, in order not to have volume overlapping with the SiPMs. The vertex generator is simulated only inside the true volume.
	- macro added that shows how to stop a decay chain at any point
	- Vertex generator added for the quartz plate.
tag v4_04_04 - 5 May 2015
	- More values of pressure added to calculate density of gaseous xenon in MaterialsList

tag v4_04_03 - 4 Apr 2015
	- EL table generation scheme changed to generation of the whole statistics 
	for a given range of points, for NEW and NEXT-100 geometry.

tag 4.04.00 - 9 Feb 2015
	- Version of nexus that depends on Geant4-10. It is backward-incompatible, 
	meaning that cannot be used with previous versions of Geant4. 
	The last tag with Geant4-9.6 is 4.03.10 
	- Change in the electromagnetic physics list: from 
	G4EmLivermorePhysics to G4EmStandardPhysics_option4

tag 4.03.10 - 23 Jan 2015
	- Addition to the NEW geometry: steel beam structure in the lead
	castle, PMT bases, piggy tale connectors
	- Reorganization of the Event Actions
	- Scintillation yield parameter added to the NEW geometries
	- Specific vertex generation option added to the NEW geometry

tag 4.03.08 - 18 Sept 2014
	- Major modifications to the NEW geometry, according to the latest drawings.
	- A few new parameters added for the EL process.
	- Bug fixed in the storage of metadata.

tag 4.03.03 - 5 Mar 2014
	-Next1EL.cc: back to using the most recent simulation of TPB wavelength shifting.
