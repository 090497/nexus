=============================================
  NEXT MonteCarlo (Geant4-based) simulation 
=============================================

This is a Geant4-based application to study possibilities offered by
a MicroMegas-readout TPC to discover the neutrino-less double beta
decay (bb0nu).

NEXT stands for "Neutrino Experiment with a Xenon TPC".

Availability
=============
Alpha release


Installation
=============
Needed packages:
  * Geant 4.8.1 (with headers and libs)
  * CLHEP
  * BHEP (and HDF5)
  * OpenGL (for visualization)


Configure and compile
=====================
You must setup the Geant4 package in the proper way
(see the G4 installation instructions for that).
If Geant4 libraries are not located in /usr/local, 
you must set the environment variable "G4LBS" with the PATH 
where they are. Typically, this should be 
a reasonable setup:

export G4INSTALL= <path to your Geant4 local installation>
export G4WORKDIR=$G4INSTALL
export G4SYSTEM=Linux-g++
export G4INCLUDE=$G4INSTALL/include
export G4TEMP=$G4INSTALL/tmp
export G4LIB=$G4INSTALL/lib
export G4BIN=$G4WORKDIR/bin
export G4LEVELGAMMADATA=$G4INSTALL/data/PhotonEvaporation
export G4RADIOACTIVEDATA=$G4INSTALL/data/RadiativeDecay
export G4LEDATA=$G4INSTALL/../G4EMLOW2.2
export G4NeutronHPCrossSections=$G4INSTALL/../G4NDL3.7

export G4VIS_BUILD_OPENGLX_DRIVER=1
export G4VIS_USE_OPENGLX=1
export OGLHOME=/usr/local

export G4LBS=$G4LIB/$G4SYSTEM
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/X11R6/lib:$G4LBS

To build the binaries:
$ sh autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make

and good luck.


Clean everything
================
In case you need to clean the stuff for a rebuild from scratch:

$ make clean


Run the program
===============
The simulation program looks for two parameters file:
  - input.par: general configuration settings and physics options.
  - geom/next.geom: geometry parameters file

Some example files are provided with this package.

To run the simulation:
$ ./xnext <options>

Valid options:
   - vis or visual: visual mode (needs OpenGL)
